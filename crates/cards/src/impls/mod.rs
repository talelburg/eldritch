//! Hand-implemented card effects.
//!
//! Each implemented card lives in its own submodule, exposing a
//! [`CODE`](holy_rosary::CODE) constant and an `abilities()` function
//! returning that card's [`Vec<Ability>`](game_core::dsl::Ability).
//!
//! The registry is the [`abilities_for`] dispatch — adding a card
//! means: drop a `crates/cards/src/impls/<name>.rs` file, declare the
//! `pub mod <name>;` here, and add a match arm in [`abilities_for`].
//! The crate's [`is_playable`](super::is_playable) check derives from
//! `abilities_for(code).is_some()`, so the two queries can never go
//! out of sync.
//!
//! # Module-naming convention
//!
//! Filenames are the card's lowercase snake-case name. When two
//! printings share a name (revised core / Chapter 2 reprints), the
//! later printings get a set suffix: `holy_rosary` for the original
//! core, `holy_rosary_rcore` if a revised-core variant lands. Codes
//! are the disambiguator at the registry level; filenames just stay
//! greppable.
//!
//! # Implemented so far
//!
//! - Holy Rosary (01059) — `Trigger::Constant` + unqualified
//!   `WhileInPlay`.
//! - Working a Hunch (01037) — `Trigger::OnPlay` + `DiscoverClue`.
//! - Magnifying Glass (01030) — `Trigger::Constant` +
//!   `WhileInPlayDuring(SkillTestKind::Investigate)`.
//!
//! Remaining Phase-3 cards (Hyperawareness #38, Deduction #39,
//! Roland Banks #55, Study #56) each block on a DSL primitive the
//! cards crate doesn't yet emit — activated triggers, commit
//! windows, `OnEvent` reactions, location-state shape.
