# Phase 7 — The Gathering

## Status

🛠️ **Slice 1 planned** (kickoff [#216](https://github.com/talelburg/eldritch/issues/216)).
Phase decomposed into vertical slices; Slice 1 (Roland through The
Gathering, solo, Standard) is specced and the engine spine is planned.
Design spec:
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-10-phase-7-slice-1-gathering-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-10-phase-7-slice-1-gathering-design.md).

## Goal

First real scenario playable in browser, solo, all 5 investigators.

## Slice 1 — Roland through The Gathering

Vertical-slice-first: one investigator playable end-to-end (solo,
Standard, win/lose-path fidelity) before breadth. Deferred north-star
work: `emit_event` dispatch unification (`#212`) + iterative
trigger-ordering (`#213`), folding in `#117`.

| C | content: Gathering scenario cards + setup + Roland + signature/weakness + starter deck | TBD | 📐 spec'd |
| D | integration & web: investigator/scenario picker; end-to-end Won/Lost gate | TBD | 📐 spec'd |

Group A *extends* the existing `reaction_windows.rs` OnEvent machinery
(not greenfield); forced scenario effects take a separate immediate path
(`fire_forced_triggers`) distinct from player reaction windows.

## Future slices (after Slice 1)

Not yet specced/planned in detail — recorded here so the arc survives a
fresh session. Rough order; each becomes its own spec → plan → issues
when picked up.

- **Slice 2+ — investigator breadth.** The other four original-Core
  investigators (Daisy Walker, "Skids" O'Toole, Agnes Baker, Wendy
  Adams), each with their signature asset/weakness pair and starter
  deck — the same content shape as Roland in Slice 1, reusing the engine
  spine. Likely one slice per investigator (or grouped) once Slice 1
  proves the pipe. Goal: all five picker-eligible.
- **Difficulty selection.** Slice 1 ships **Standard** only. Add Easy /
  Hard / Expert chaos bags + a difficulty picker.
- **Solo-with-2 UX.** One client driving two investigators — how the
  picker, turn flow, and board present two characters under one player.
  Genuinely open design question (see Open questions).
- **Deferred optional Gathering content** (off the win/lose path, so cut
  from Slice 1): Lita Chantler's parley/take-control and the Parlor
  (`01115`) **Resign** action.
- **Engine north-star (cross-slice, may be its own slice).** `emit_event`
  dispatch unification (`#212`) + iterative simultaneous-trigger ordering
  (`#213`, RR p.17 — player picks order even in solo) + the trigger
  index (`#117`); plus the optional click-to-resolve UX for *lone* forced
  effects. Slice 1's `fire_forced_triggers` is a forward-compatible
  subset; this work replaces its single-trigger-only limitation.

Campaign sequencing beyond The Gathering (The Midnight Masks, The
Devourer Below, campaign log + `Fact` enum) is **Phase 9**, not Phase 7.

## Issues (filed)

| # | Title | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `#65` | skill-test other-investigator commits | Needed for multi-investigator commit scenarios; tagged Phase 7 because that's the first real-card consumer. |
| `#77` | Parley + Engage actions | Basic player actions needed for full scenario coverage. |

## Decisions made

- **The Gathering** is the first scenario of the original Core Set's *Night of the Zealot* campaign. Three locations to start (Study + connections), with the campaign expanding from there.
- **"Solo with 1–2 investigators" is the supported mode** for this phase. Multiplayer (two human investigators on different machines) is Phase 8.
- **All 5 original-Core investigators implementable:** Roland Banks (`#55`, already filed in Phase 3), Daisy Walker, "Skids" O'Toole, Agnes Baker, Wendy Adams. Each needs their card impl + signature cards.

## Open questions

The Phase-6-era "scoping TBD" list is now addressed by the slice
structure above — the scenario module, encounter/act/agenda/location
impls, Roland, and Standard difficulty are **Slice 1** (kickoff `#216`);
the other investigators, difficulties, solo-2 UX, and optional content
map to **Future slices**. Genuinely-open design questions that remain:

- **Solo-with-2 UX.** One player controls two investigators; how does
  the client present that (picker, whose-turn, two boards vs. tabbed)?
  Unresolved — a Future-slice design question.
- **Story-asset/weakness shape.** Cover Up (Roland's, in Slice 1) is
  scoped, but the broader campaign-driven mods (Lita Chantler, Hospital
  Debts, …) need a pattern; revisit as they land.

## Dependencies

- Phase 4 (scenario plumbing) — the scenario module API.
- Phase 5 (server + persistence) — backing store.
- Phase 6 (web client v0) — UI.
- Phase 3 (`#55` Roland Banks, `#56` Study) — already filed there; these spill into Phase 7's coverage.

## What "done" looks like

A solo human, in the browser, picks an investigator, sets up The Gathering, plays through the scenario to a resolution. All five investigators are picker-eligible. The campaign log records the resolution's facts. Standard difficulty works correctly; harder difficulties may land here or in a polish pass.
